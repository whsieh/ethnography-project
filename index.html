    <h1 id="title">Redesigning Tzu Chi Academy</h1>
    <h3 class="subtitle">I. The Layout</h3>
    <p class="text">Tzu Chi Tri-Valley Academy, known colloquially as Tzu Chi Chinese School, borrows space from Pleasanton Middle School every Saturday. The K-12 school was founded in 2011, and is operated by the Taiwanese Buddhist organization "Tzu Chi." While there are less than 200 students in total, enrollment has risen quickly since its founding. My first step was to survey the site, starting with the layout.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">II. The Taxonomy</h3>
    <p class="text">Through interviews with the staff, I compiled a vocabulary of special terms and concepts at Tzu Chi Chinese school, represented here as a directed graph. The interviews and this taxonomy helped me discover which terms are most important in the organization and consequently, which concepts, ideals, and values are most important in the Chinese school and Tzu Chi as a whole.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitle">III. Classroom Redesign</h3>
    <p class="text">I first set out to redesign the classroom environment. I noticed how some rooms were arranged in group format, while others were in lecture format. However, the instructors at Tzu Chi Chinese School all teach in a lecture format, making it hard for some students in group-oriented desks to see a particular whiteboard. To solve this, I introduce pivoting, sliding chairs to the classroom, which will allow students to quickly reorient themselves in any direction, supporting both groupwork- and lecture-oriented classroom layouts.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">IV. Food Table Redesign</h3>
    <p class="text">The monthly food tables are important events for both staff and students. Unfortunately, they are held in the small space outside Room 507 (marked 2 in the <a href="javascript:scrollToLayout()">above layout</a>) which tends to get very crowded inconveniencing both staff and students. As such, I plan to move the site of these food tables over to the main walkway. Not only does this provide more space, but it also allows Tzu Chi Chinese School to put students' projects on display, as well as use the extra space for fundraising and selling green merchandise.</p>
